# Querying


The atomic notes philosophy prescribes breaking notes into units of knowledge. They are recomposed through transclusion. Many notes may actually be of the same kind, such as a document of examples, which increases the amount of files that can be proliferated.

In this example, we will transclude a specific example from another document. We will _restrict_ to only the examples in that file.

This directory is relative to the file the file is being called in. It needs to be called from a project root. The do parameter can be written in code.
